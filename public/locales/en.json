    "faq-ari-5OTmpo8i.question": "What does Arien's Slippery Ground restrict?",
    "faq-ari-5OTmpo8i.answer": "This card restricts the movement, by a movement action, of Heroes in radius. It will **not** affect pushing, swapping, or placement effects (including fast travel!). It also will **not** restrict movement as part of other actions (such as Brogan‚Äôs Primary Red or Tigerclaw‚Äôs Primary Green).\nAdditionally, because movement restrictions are checked at the beginning of a movement, a Hero can freely move into and through the radius of Arien‚Äôs effect without being affected.",
    "faq-bro-UGm22plF.question": "Is the movement required?",

A crafty opponent can anticipate and deny this attack with clever positioning.\n- Brogan can charge next to an immune unit, at which point his attack would fizzle.\n- Brogan can charge through Min‚Äôs Smoke Bomb Token, since the Smoke Bomb only prevents targeting across the Smoke Bomb and Brogan would not target until after the movement.",

    "faq-common-5eb64zdk.answer": "No. Fast Travel is a special type of action that usually replaces a Movement action. They are related but different:\n\n- When you would take a Movement action, you can fast travel instead.\n- If you use a primary Movement action to Fast Travel, you would ignore the card text, since you are replacing the action.\n- A card that lets you move (‚ÄúMove 2 spaces‚Ä¶‚Äù) would not let you Fast Travel instead.\n- If you are prevented from moving or from taking a Movement action, you could not use a Movement action to Fast Travel.\n- If you are limited in how you move (‚ÄúMay only move 1 space‚Äù), you may still Fast Travel as normal, since you are allowed to select, then replace, the Movement action (and Fast Travel is a placement, not movement).",

    "faq-dod-9oAe2b05.answer": "She can return a friendly defeated/removed minion of any type to any spawn point. \n- It need not be a matching minion type or color: if her friendly ranged minion is defeated, Dodger could respawn it on an enemy melee minion spawn point. \n- It must be a minion that was originally in play in this wave, before being defeated or removed. Dodger cannot ‚Äúrespawn‚Äù a minion that was not originally in play at the start of the wave.\n - She must respawn a minion directly onto a spawn point. She cannot respawn the minion on a space adjacent to the spawn point. Note that this is different than respawning minions after the lane pushes.",
    "faq-sabina-AR1boyR4.question": "Does Sabina gain the attack bonus against Heroes who have played but not resolved an attack card?",
    "faq-sabina-AR1boyR4.answer": "Yes: the card only checks for Heroes that **played** an attack card, regardless of whether they‚Äôve resolved the action, which action they performed, and even whether this is still their card for the turn (it will ‚Äúremember‚Äù whether they have played a card, even if it is discarded or switched for another card by an effect).",
    "faq-sil-VBPVBU86.question": "When can Silverarrow‚Äôs Gold Fast Travel?",
    "faq-sil-VBPVBU86.answer": "The Fast Travel has all the normal restrictions of a Fast Travel action: there must be no enemy Heroes or Minions in her Zone, and if not, she can move anywhere in her Zone or to an adjacent Zone with no enemy Heroes or Minions.\n_Note that this is a rare instance of a Fast Travel which is not replacing a movement action. Silverarrow could Fast Travel (if valid), even if she cannot move due to another effect._",
    "faq-sil-BNCeD4CM.question": "Does Silverarrow‚Äôs Primary Blue (Grasping Roots) affect a Hero who moves in range of Silverarrow during their movement?",
    "faq-sil-BNCeD4CM.answer": "No, movement restrictions are checked at the beginning of the movement.",
    "faq-tal-bgAzAr8M.question": "What communication is legal for Tali‚Äôs Silver (Commune With Spirits)?",
    "faq-tal-bgAzAr8M.answer": "All Table Talk and Communication is fully open - to teammates and opponents (p. 4). A Tali player can give teammates instructions like ‚ÄúSay Blue‚Äù or ‚ÄúSay Red if Sabina plays Gold, otherwise say Green,‚Äù as long as the opponents can hear (and understand) these instructions. The Tali player may not secretly indicate their desire to their teammates by whispering, gestures, showing cards, a private code, etc.",
    "faq-tal-e2Ja6hsd.question": "If Tali tries to resolve her Silver (Commune with the Spirits) and her whole team is dead or immune, what happens?",
    "faq-tal-e2Ja6hsd.answer": "No friendly hero can be chosen and the card does nothing.",
    "faq-tal-5K1OWmD6.question": "Tali‚Äôs Alternate Green (Ancestral Totem) makes a Totem that can protect a minion. If the Totem is removed, does the Hero gain coins?",
    "faq-tal-5K1OWmD6.answer": "No. The Totem is removed instead of the minion being defeated, so no minion is defeated and no coins are gained.",
    "faq-tig-RZOM5aw8.question": "Does Tigerclaw‚Äôs Blink Strike attack require movement?",
    "faq-tig-RZOM5aw8.answer": "Yes! If Tigerclaw cannot move through the target in a straight line, the effect will ‚Äúfizzle‚Äù ‚Äî stop resolving ‚Äî and he will not attack. A crafty opponent can anticipate and deny this attack with clever positioning.",
    "faq-tig-mkia6OEY.question": "How does Tigerclaw‚Äôs Silver (Blend into Shadows) activate?",
    "faq-tig-mkia6OEY.answer": "Tigerclaw must begin his turn adjacent to an obstacle (including any unit), then place himself into a space in radius that is not adjacent to an enemy unit. If he does so, he will be immune and can move through units during the next turn. Remember that immunity means he cannot be targeted or affected by any action, can move through tokens (not stop movement on them), and may ignore token effects.",
    "faq-tig-qmf2Koiz.question": "Does Tigerclaw‚Äôs green thievery skill require an enemy hero?",
    "faq-tig-qmf2Koiz.answer": "Yes, to perform it completely. After Tigerclaw performs the first movement on the card, it checks for an adjacent enemy hero to steal from. If there is no adjacent enemy hero, the card ‚Äúfizzles‚Äù ‚Äî stops resolving ‚Äî and he will not make the final movement. In this case, it is usually better to simply play the card for its movement.\n - Note that Tigerclaw can move next to an enemy hero with no coins (or whom he chooses not to rob) in order to get the full movement.\n - If Tigerclaw is not able to move 2 spaces in a straight line, he will not make the final movement at all.\n - There are cases where performing Primary Green without an enemy hero is still advantageous, such as if other effects restrict movement actions (such as Arien‚Äôs Alt Blue or Xargatha‚Äôs Primary Blue) or other effects will reward him for performing a skill action.",
    "faq-tig-JfrPJWdN.question": "What happens if Tigerclaw‚Äôs poison reduces a value below 1?",
    "faq-tig-JfrPJWdN.answer": "Values can drop to 0 and even be negative:\n- Initiative values are resolved in the normal order from highest to lowest.\n- Negative defense values are calculated normally and may still block an attack if the Defense Total is greater than or equal to the Attack Total.\n- Negative Attack Totals will still defeat a Minion and must still be defended against (or will defeat the hero).",
    "faq-urs-znPgp2l0.question": "Does Ursafar gain coins for removing a minion on his Primary Red?",
    "faq-urs-znPgp2l0.answer": "No. Coins are only gained for defeating a Minion, not Removing one.",
    "faq-urs-ZpV2cmhu.question": "Would Ursafar‚Äôs Ultimate (Unbound Fury) allow him to move using his Silver (Angry Roar)?",
    "faq-urs-ZpV2cmhu.answer": "No. The second effect on Angry Roar, +2 Movement, will only increase the Movement value of a card which already has a Movement Action.",
    "faq-wasp-P8qD2hsM.question": "How does Wasp‚Äôs Static Barrier work?",
    "faq-wasp-P8qD2hsM.answer": "Static Barrier divides the map into 2 regions: spaces within its radius and outside its radius. Enemy units cannot **move** or **fast travel** across the ‚Äúbarrier‚Äù between the two regions:\n- They cannot take a move action (to move or fast travel) to move across the barrier.\n- They cannot use an attack or skill involving movement to cross the barrier.\n- They cannot cross the barrier on their path, even if they cross back. That is, a hero outside the barrier cannot walk into the radius and then walk back out.\n- They can use a ‚Äúplace‚Äù or ‚Äúswap‚Äù effect (such as Arien‚Äôs Alt Blue) to cross the barrier.\n- They can be pushed across the barrier (pushing is not movement) or moved by another player‚Äôs card.",
    "faq-wasp-iOUfdU2P.question": "How does Wasp‚Äôs ability move units and tokens?",
    "faq-wasp-iOUfdU2P.answer": "The target cannot move farther away or closer, so the distance between you and the target must remain unchanged.",
    "faq-wasp-6LS6R1fC.question": "When does Wasp‚Äôs  push ability force a discard?",
    "faq-wasp-6LS6R1fC.answer": "This card pushes adjacent enemies away from you (in a straight line). If an enemy Hero cannot be pushed the full distance, because an obstacle is located along the straight line path, the Hero is forced to discard.",
    "faq-wasp-uCXB6YGe.question": "Why do Wasp‚Äôs Tier II and III abilities say ‚ÄúIf you do‚Äù? Why would the block fail?",
    "faq-wasp-uCXB6YGe.answer": "You can always discard a card to attempt to defend, even if it does not defend successfully.",
    "faq-whi-TDtkq39W.question": "When Whisper plays Gold (Swift Justice) against an enemy Hero, how do they move?",
    "faq-whi-TDtkq39W.answer": "First, the targeted Hero chooses and discards a Card of their choice (if they have any cards remaining in hand). If they do so and the discarded Card has a movement value, that Hero must then move that distance in a straight line. They would only be unable to do so (and therefore stay on the same space) if they could not move the full movement value in a straight line in any of the 6 directions from their current space.",
    "faq-whi-2Sh4CgpI.question": "Does this ability require an enemy Hero? Can they pick an option that does nothing?",
    "faq-whi-2Sh4CgpI.answer": "Whisper‚Äôs Alternate Blue requires targeting an enemy Hero in range or it will fizzle and have no effect. That Hero then picks one of the two options, regardless of whether they will have any effect. In other words, the card won‚Äôt ‚Äúwork‚Äù unless Whisper is adjacent to a Minion.\n Note that on Tier III, Whisper can target 3 minions simultaneously. He cannot use this action to defeat the last non-Heavy Minion at the same time as the Heavy.",
    "faq-xar-uxm2IDQl.question": "What does Xargatha's Stone Gaze affect and not affect?",
    "faq-xar-uxm2IDQl.answer": "It prevents ‚Äúmovement actions‚Äù, that is, selecting the movement option when resolving a card:\n - ‚ùå They **can‚Äôt** use a normal movement action to move.\n - ‚ùå They **can‚Äôt** use a movement action to fast travel (which chooses, then replaces, a movement action).\n - ‚úÖ They **can** use a ‚Äúplace‚Äù or ‚Äúswap‚Äù effect (such as Arien‚Äôs Alt Blue).\n - ‚úÖ They **can** be pushed or moved by another effect (if the effect ignores immunity).\n - ‚úÖ They **can** take another action type that involves movement (such as Brogan‚Äôs Primary Red) or a Fast Travel (Silverarrow‚Äôs Gold).",
    "faq-xar-BBNWEowq.question": "Does Xargatha's Constrict affect heavy minions as well?",
    "faq-xar-BBNWEowq.answer": "No. Initially you can only kill **melee** minions, but on Tier 3 you can get melee or ranged minions, but never the heavy minion."
