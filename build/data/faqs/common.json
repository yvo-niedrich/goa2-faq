        "q": "What does immunity protect from?",
        "a": "Basically everything. An immune unit can’t be targeted or affected by any action. They can choose to move through and ignore tokens.\nBeware that conditional immunity only applies when the sources of an effect matches the condition (eg. “immune to enemy attack actions”)",

        "a": "No. Fast Travel is a special type of action that usually replaces a Movement action. They are related but different:\n\n- When you would take a Movement action, you can fast travel instead.\n- If you use a primary Movement action to Fast Travel, you would ignore the card text, since you are replacing the action.\n- A card that lets you move (“Move 2 spaces…”) would not let you Fast Travel instead.\n- If you are prevented from moving or from taking a Movement action, you could not use a Movement action to Fast Travel.\n- If you are limited in how you move (“May only move 1 space”), you may still Fast Travel as normal, since you are allowed to select, then replace, the Movement action (and Fast Travel is a placement, not movement).",

You place the card on your hero dashboard, and your turn ends.\n_See page 10 of the rulebook for additional reference._",
