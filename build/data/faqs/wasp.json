        "a": "Static Barrier divides the map into 2 regions: spaces within its radius and outside its radius. Enemy units are restricted by the “barrier” as follows:\n- ❌They cannot take a move action (to move or fast travel) to move across the barrier.\n- ❌They cannot use an attack or skill involving movement to cross the barrier.\n- ❌They cannot end any movement on the other side of the barrier - even if they are allowed to “move **through** obstacles”.\n- ❌They cannot push units through the barrier unless the push is “ignoring obstacles” - in which case the target still has to reach an **empty** space.\n- ✅They can use a “swap” effect to cross the barrier and remain on the other side (Swap “does not count as movement or placement.”).\n- ✅They can perform an attack that targets a unit on the other side of the barrier.\n\n**Reminder**: These restrictions only apply when an **enemy hero** is taking the action.",
