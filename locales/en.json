You could not use Mind Grip’s copy ability to copy a card while defending.\n- Active effects he copies will work normally, as though NebKher’s Gold was an exact copy of the card. The effect remains, even if the originally copied card changes state or the hero is defeated.\n- When NebKher copies effects that place tokens, he places Illusion tokens instead. They will not take on the properties of the copied tokens.\n- If NebKher copies cards that specifically refer to tokens, NebKher uses those tokens as those heroes would (such as Min’s mines or smoke bombs, or Wuk’s trees).\n- NebKher can copy Trinkets’ cards to remove and/or place the Turret.\n- If NebKher copies an action that says “this card”, it means the card with the printed ability, not Neb’s. He cannot copy Brogan’s Silver (Bullwark), for example, then retrieve his Gold.\n- Although it can copy attacks, Mind Grip is a skill card, so some card resolutions may happen differently. Examples:\n     - If NebKher copies a non-ranged attack, he is performing a non-ranged attack (even though his Gold card is a ranged skill). A non-ranged attack he is using could not be blocked by Tigerclaw’s Primary Blue (Dodge) or Wasp’s Primary Green (Stop Projectiles), both of which only block ranged attacks.\n- If NebKher copies Igantia’s Silver (Moment of Equilibrium), he will re-set the coin to a side of his choice.

Silverarrow could Fast Travel (if valid), even if she cannot move due to another effect._","faq-sil-BNCeD4CM.question":"Does Silverarrow’s Primary Blue (Grasping Roots) affect a Hero who moves in range of Silverarrow during their movement?","faq-sil-BNCeD4CM.answer":"No, movement restrictions are checked at the beginning of the movement.","faq-sil-itYXMsuM.question":"Can Silverarrow's silver allow her to fast-travel through obstacles (and travel move from beach to jungle on the single-lane map)?","faq-sil-itYXMsuM.answer":"No, ignoring obstacles has no effect on zone adjacency. Additionally, you may ignore obstacles during your movement, but fast travel is a special action that **replaces** movement.","faq-swi-6Iy6RJQH.question":"How can Swift's Silver card already be resolved while its action is being performed?","faq-swi-6Iy6RJQH.answer":"If this card is played before Swift's Gold card, it will already be resolved when the Gold card triggers it again.","faq-tal-bgAzAr8M.question":"What communication is legal for Tali’s Silver (Commune With Spirits)?","faq-tal-bgAzAr8M.answer":"All Table Talk and Communication is fully open - to teammates and opponents (p. 4). A Tali player can give teammates instructions like “Say Blue” or “Say Red if Sabina plays Gold, otherwise say Green,” as long as the opponents can hear (and understand) these instructions. The Tali player may not secretly indicate their desire to their teammates by whispering, gestures, showing cards, a private code, etc.","faq-tal-e2Ja6hsd.question":"If Tali tries to resolve her Silver (Commune with the Spirits) and her whole team is dead or immune, what happens?","faq-tal-e2Ja6hsd.answer":"No friendly hero can be chosen and the card does nothing.","faq-tal-5K1OWmD6.question":"Tali’s Alternate Green (Ancestral Totem) makes a Totem that can protect a minion. If the Totem is removed, does the Hero gain coins?","faq-tal-5K1OWmD6.answer":"No. The Totem is removed instead of the minion being defeated, so no minion is defeated and no coins are gained.","faq-tig-RZOM5aw8.question":"Does Tigerclaw’s Blink Strike attack require movement?","faq-tig-RZOM5aw8.answer":"Yes! If Tigerclaw cannot move through the target in a straight line, the effect will “fizzle” — stop resolving — and he will not attack. A crafty opponent can anticipate and deny this attack with clever positioning.","faq-tig-qmf2Koiz.question":"Does Tigerclaw’s green thievery skill require an enemy hero?","faq-tig-qmf2Koiz.answer":"Yes, to perform it completely. After Tigerclaw performs the first movement on the card, it checks for an adjacent enemy hero to steal from. If there is no adjacent enemy hero, the card “fizzles” — stops resolving — and he will not make the final movement. In this case, it is usually better to simply play the card for its movement.\n --- \nThere are cases where performing the action without an enemy hero is still advantageous, such as if other effects restrict movement actions (such as Arien’s Alt Blue or Xargatha’s Primary Blue) or other effects will reward him for performing a skill action.","faq-tig-JfrPJWdN.question":"What happens if Tigerclaw’s poison reduces a value below 1?","faq-tig-JfrPJWdN.answer":"Values can drop to 0 and even be negative:\n- Initiative values are resolved in the normal order from highest to lowest.\n- Negative defense values are calculated normally and may still block an attack if the Defense Total is greater than or equal to the Attack Total.\n- Negative Attack Totals will still defeat a Minion and must still be defended against (or will defeat the hero).","faq-tri-Gy7gS7zz.question":"What is the Turret?","faq-tri-Gy7gS7zz.answer":"It’s an obstacle and counts as terrain. It’s not a unit, minion, or hero, and it doesn’t do anything other than as instructed by Trinkets’ cards. The Turret’s presence and counting as terrain are properties, not an active effect, so they don’t change if Trinkets’ cards change zones, between rounds, or if Trinkets dies. You’re limited to the single provided Turret, so placing a Turret while it’s already on the map will reposition it, not add a Turret. Several of Trinkets’ effects require a target in range of Trinkets and the Turret, measuring the range of both of these independently.","faq-tri-Q91NHrfO.question":"How do Trinkets cards target?","faq-tri-Q91NHrfO.answer":"Several of Trinkets cards target based on the location of the Turret. While thematically the Turret is shooting them, Trinkets is still the one playing these cards, targeting enemies, etc.: the Turret only provides a targeting restriction. Therefore:\n- Arien’s Silver (Spell Break) could prevent a nearby Trinkets from using skills like Primary Blue (Disruptor Jolt) or Alt Green (Self-Destruct), even if the Turret is far away.\n- Min’s Silver (Smoke Bomb) can interrupt a Trinkets attack if the Smoke Bomb is between Trinkets and the taret, irrespective of the position of the Turret.","faq-urs-znPgp2l0.question":"Does Ursafar gain coins for removing a minion on his Primary Red?","faq-urs-znPgp2l0.answer":"No. Coins are only gained for defeating a Minion, not Removing one.","faq-urs-z0mVe4p1.question":"Does the additional movement only apply to the card it is printed on?","faq-urs-z0mVe4p1.answer":"Yes. When Ursafar is enraged, his blue allows him to move further with that explicit action. It does not apply to any other cards (there is no “**This round**” indication).","faq-wasp-P8qD2hsM.question":"How does Wasp’s Static Barrier work?","faq-wasp-P8qD2hsM.answer":"Static Barrier divides the map into 2 regions: spaces within its radius and outside its radius. Enemy units cannot **move** or **fast travel** across the “barrier” between the two regions:\n- ❌They cannot take a move action (to move or fast travel) to move across the barrier.\n- ❌They cannot use an attack or skill involving movement to cross the barrier.\n- ❌They cannot cross the barrier on their path, even if they cross back. That is, a hero outside the barrier cannot walk into the radius and then walk back out.\n- ✅They can use a “place” or “swap” effect (such as Arien’s Alt Blue) to cross the barrier.\n- ✅They can be pushed across the barrier (pushing is not movement) or moved by another player’s card.","faq-wasp-iOUfdU2P.question":"How does Wasp’s ability move units and tokens?","faq-wasp-iOUfdU2P.answer":"The target cannot move farther away or closer, so the distance between you and the target must remain unchanged.","faq-wasp-6LS6R1fC.question":"When does Wasp’s  push ability force a discard?","faq-wasp-6LS6R1fC.answer":"This card pushes adjacent enemies away from you (in a straight line). If an enemy Hero cannot be pushed the full distance, because an obstacle is located along the straight line path, the Hero is forced to discard.","faq-wasp-uCXB6YGe.question":"Why do Wasp’s Tier II and III abilities say “If you do”? Why would the block fail?","faq-wasp-uCXB6YGe.answer":"You can always discard a card to attempt to defend, even if it does not defend successfully.","faq-wasp-uDFB6GGe.question":"Does Wasp’s Gold prevent movement?","faq-wasp-uDFB6GGe.answer":"No, Wasp’s dagger interferes with magical placement abilites – and only if they are controlled by enemy heroes. Normal movement and pushes can still be used by enemy heroes to reposition.","faq-wasp-jjFB6hGs.question":"Can enemies from further away use their placement abilities to approach Wasp?","faq-wasp-jjFB6hGs.answer":"Yes, the ability does **not** prevent enemey heroes from placing or swapping themselfs (or their friends) into the radius of Wasp’s dagger.","faq-whi-TDtkq39W.question":"When Whisper plays Gold (Swift Justice) against an enemy Hero, how do they move?","faq-whi-TDtkq39W.answer":"First, the targeted Hero chooses and discards a Card of their choice (if they have any cards remaining in hand). If they do so and the discarded Card has a movement value, that Hero must then move that distance in a straight line. They would only be unable to do so (and therefore stay on the same space) if they could not move the full movement value in a straight line in any of the 6 directions from their current space.","faq-whi-2Sh4CgpI.question":"Does this ability require an enemy Hero? Can they pick an option that does nothing?","faq-whi-2Sh4CgpI.answer":"Whisper’s Alternate Blue requires targeting an enemy Hero in range or it will fizzle and have no effect. That Hero then picks one of the two options, regardless of whether they will have any effect. In other words, the card won’t “work” unless Whisper is adjacent to a Minion.\n Note that on Tier III, Whisper can target 3 minions simultaneously. He cannot use this action to defeat the last non-Heavy Minion at the same time as the Heavy.","faq-wuk-O48Zw7g2.question":"When moving through a heavy minion and another one, does the order of minions matter?","faq-wuk-O48Zw7g2.answer":"\"Up to two minions\" resolves at the same time, so the heavy minion cannot be targeted and will not be defeated.","faq-xar-uxm2IDQl.question":"What does Xargatha's Stone Gaze affect and not affect?","faq-xar-uxm2IDQl.answer":"It prevents “movement actions”, that is, selecting the movement option when resolving a card:\n - ❌ They **can’t** use a normal movement action to move.\n - ❌ They **can’t** use a movement action to fast travel (which chooses, then replaces, a movement action).\n - ✅ They **can** use a “place” or “swap” effect (such as Arien’s Alt Blue).\n - ✅ They **can** be pushed or moved by another effect (if the effect ignores immunity).\n - ✅ They **can** take another action type that involves movement (such as Brogan’s Primary Red) or a Fast Travel (Silverarrow’s Gold).","faq-xar-BBNWEowq.question":"Does Xargatha's Constrict affect heavy minions as well?","faq-xar-BBNWEowq.answer":"No. Initially you can only kill **melee** minions, but on Tier 3 you can get melee or ranged minions, but never the heavy minion.","faq-common-OmbzNwt1.question":"What does immunity protect from?","faq-common-OmbzNwt1.answer":"Basically everything. An immune unit can’t be targeted or affected by any action.

Isn’t that non-ranged?","faq-common-J6uK9mGB.answer":"A range of 1 can only target an adjacent space (but the range may be increased by items or other effects). A range of 0 has no targets.\nSome cards **explicitly** interact with ranged or non-ranged attacks.","faq-common-5eb64zdk.question":"Is Fast Travel the same thing as movement?","faq-common-5eb64zdk.answer":"No. Fast Travel is a special type of action that usually replaces a Movement action. They are related but different:\n\n- When you would take a Movement action, you can fast travel instead.\n- If you use a primary Movement action to Fast Travel, you would ignore the card text, since you are replacing the action.\n- A card that lets you move (“Move 2 spaces…”) would not let you Fast Travel instead.\n- If you are prevented from moving or from taking a Movement action, you could not use a Movement action to Fast Travel.\n- If you are limited in how you move (“May only move 1 space”), you may still Fast Travel as normal, since you are allowed to select, then replace, the Movement action (and Fast Travel is a placement, not movement).","faq-common-Xe16hzf0.question":"Does my effect trigger next round?","faq-common-Xe16hzf0.answer":"No. Active effects always “clear” at the end of the round: A “next turn” effect played on Turn 4 will **not** carry over to the next round.","faq-common-Xe16hz1a.question":"What are Obstacles?","faq-common-Xe16hz1a.answer":"Obstacles are basically anything on the map: Units (Heroes and Minions), terrain shown on the map, tokens, and any other miniatures. There can only be one Obstacle on each space, and Obstacles generally can’t move through each other. If an ability does allow Obstacles to pass through each other (“you can move through Obstacles”, ignore Obstacles”, “Heroes may move through a space with a tree token”), they still may not end movement on such a space.","faq-common-xNApYXXu.question":"Would an immune hero trigger effects, that require adjacency?","faq-common-xNApYXXu.answer":"No. Whenever you are required to check the status of a unit, it counts as targeting, which you cannot do with an immune unit. This is different from cards such as Sabina's Steady Advance where you simply check the presence of units, rather than their status.","faq-common-itYXMsuM.question":"Can my hero target themself with this ability?","faq-common-itYXMsuM.answer":"No. If your action is affecting you (your hero), it will say so in the card text.

You place the card on your hero dashboard, and your turn ends.\n_See page 10 of the rulebook for additional reference._","faq-common-XrLhpx8c.question":"How does temporary immunity interact with abilities and triggers that target a unit at end of turn?","faq-common-XrLhpx8c.answer":"All players resolve their End of Turn abilities **before the turn ends**, so a unit that is immune during “this turn” is still immune when end of turn resolves.\n Because immune units cannot be chosen as targets, they are still protected from end of turn effects such as Min’s Death Grenade."}
